## Simple Habit Building Concept

Creating small, sustainable habits is more effective than attempting massive changes. The key is to start with actions so small they seem almost silly to skip.

### Core Principles

1. **Start Tiny**: Begin with 2-minute actions
2. **Build Slowly**: Add complexity only after consistency
3. **Celebrate Wins**: Acknowledge every small success
