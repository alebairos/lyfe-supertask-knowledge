# Final Test - Package Execution Logging

## Complete Implementation

This tests the complete package execution logging feature with:

1. **Session Management**: Unique session IDs for each pipeline run
2. **Log Correlation**: All prompts and processing tagged with session context
3. **Package Documentation**: Complete audit trail in each package

## Expected Results

When packaged, this should include:
- Session-specific prompt logs
- Processing execution logs  
- Human-readable execution summary
- Structured metadata with performance metrics

This demonstrates complete traceability from source content to final package.
