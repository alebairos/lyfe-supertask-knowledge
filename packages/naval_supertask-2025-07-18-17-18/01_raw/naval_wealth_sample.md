1. Seek Wealth, Not Money or Status  
Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep  
Naval is a prolific tech investor and founder of AngelList  
Nivi: You probably know Naval from his  Twitter  account.  
We’re going to talk about his  tweetstorm, “ How To Get Rich (without getting lucky) .” 
We’ll go through most of the tweets in detail , give Naval a chance to expand on them 
and generally riff on the topic. He’ll probably throw in ideas he hasn’t published before.  
Naval’s the co -founder of  AngelList  and Epinions. He’s also a prolific tech investor in 
comp anies like Twitter, Uber and many more.  
I’m the co -founder of AngelList with Naval. And I co -authored the  Venture Hacks  blog 
with him back in the day.  
Naval:  The “How to Get Rich” tweetstorm definitely hit a nerve and went viral. A lot of 
people say it was helpful and reached across aisles.  
People outside of the tech industry —people in all walks of life —want to know how to 
solve their money problems. Everyone vaguely knows  they want to be wealthy, but they 
don’t have a good set of principles to do it by.  
Wealth is assets that earn while you sleep  
Nivi:  What’s the difference between wealth, money and status?  
Naval:  Wealth is the thing you want. Wealth is assets that earn whi le you sleep; it’s the 
factory of robots cranking out things. Wealth is the computer program running at night 
that’s serving other customers. Wealth is money in the bank that is reinvested into other 
assets and businesses.  
A house can be a form of wealth, because you can rent it out; although that’s a less 
productive use of land than running a commercial enterprise.  
My definition of wealth is oriented toward businesses and assets that can earn while 
you sleep.  
Wealth buys your freedom  
You want wealth becaus e it buys you freedom —so you don’t have to wear a tie like a 
collar around your neck; so you don’t have to wake up at 7:00 a.m. to rush to work and 
sit in commute traffic; so you don’t have to waste your life grinding productive hours 
away into a soulless job that doesn’t fulfill you.  
The purpose of wealth is freedom; it’s nothing more than that. It’s not to buy fur coats, 
or to drive Ferraris, or to sail yachts, or to jet around the world in a Gulf Stream. That
