# Session Logging Test

## Simple Content

This is test content to demonstrate the session logging and package execution logging feature.

### Key Points

1. **Session Tracking**: Each pipeline run gets a unique session ID
2. **Log Correlation**: All logs are tagged with session context  
3. **Package Documentation**: Complete audit trail in each package

### Example

When you run the preprocessing pipeline, all prompts, processing steps, and results are captured with session context for complete traceability.
