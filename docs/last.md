- consider raw data for now as a folder with one or more files (pdf, txt, etc) that in the future could be the results of scrapping, social media posts, etc). The preprocessed format (intermediate step) could be something like src/templates/knowledge_task_input_template.md, maybe adding metadata header form the original sources processed.
-An intermediate preprocessed step could be interesting, since users can write this md manually, rather than providing raw data.
