- **Trust GPT-4**: Modern LLMs are incredibly capable
- **Clear instructions**: Comprehensive prompts > complex processing
- **Minimal interference**: Don't corrupt what already works
- **Simple architecture**: Easy to understand and maintain
- **Assumption**: Good prompts yield good results directly
