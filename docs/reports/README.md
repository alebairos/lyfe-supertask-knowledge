# Supertask Reports Documentation

This directory contains analysis reports for the Lyfe Supertask Knowledge Generator system.

## Purpose

The reporting system analyzes supertasks created from raw input data, focusing on:

1. **What supertasks were produced** - Titles, topics, learning objectives
2. **Content quality analysis** - Structure, completeness, educational value  
3. **Format compliance** - How well outputs match input JSON structure
4. **Template adherence** - Compliance with `knowledge_task_input_template.md`

## Report Types

### `supertask_analysis.md`
The main analysis report generated by `src/lyfe_kt/simple_report.py`. Contains:

- **Summary Statistics**: Files processed, success rates, compliance metrics
- **Supertasks Created**: Details of each supertask produced
- **Format Compliance Analysis**: Critical issues with JSON structure
- **Recommendations**: Clear next steps for improvement

## Key Requirements

The system should produce supertask JSON files that:
- **Maintain exact same format** as input JSON files
- **Preserve all original metadata** (dimension, archetype, relatedToType, etc.)
- **Enhance content within `flexibleItems` array** using the knowledge task template
- **Follow the `knowledge_task_input_template.md` structure** for content organization

## Current Status

As of the latest analysis:
- ❌ **Critical Issue**: Output JSON format doesn't match input structure
- ❌ **Missing Fields**: `relatedToType`, `relatedToId`, `estimatedDuration`, `coinsReward`, `flexibleItems`
- ✅ **Content Quality**: Educational content is well-structured and valuable

## Usage

Generate reports using the simple report generator:

```bash
python src/lyfe_kt/simple_report.py work/01_raw/input_dir work/02_preprocessed/output_dir > docs/reports/analysis.md
```

## Philosophy

Reports should be:
- **Simple and focused** - No unnecessary complexity
- **Actionable** - Clear problems and solutions
- **Content-oriented** - Focus on what supertasks were created
- **Compliance-focused** - Ensure outputs match expected format

This approach eliminates the previous overly complex reporting system in favor of clear, actionable insights about supertask creation and quality.
